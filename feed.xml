&lt;p class=&quot;text-justify&quot;&gt;This paper proposes an automated framework for quantitative verification and 
design space exploration of cyber-physical systems in the presence of 
uncertainty, leveraging assume-guarantee con- tracts expressed in Stochastic 
Signal Temporal Logic (StSTL). We introduce quantitative semantics for StSTL 
and formulations of the quantitative verification and design space exploration 
problems as bi-level optimization problems. We show that these optimization 
problems can be effectively solved for a class of stochastic systems and a 
fragment of bounded-time StSTL formulas. Our algorithm searches for partitions 
of the upper-level design space such that the solutions of the lower-level 
problems satisfy the upper-level constraints. A set of optimal parameter values 
are then selected within these partitions. We illustrate the effectiveness of 
our framework on the design of a multi-sensor perception system and an 
automatic cruise control system.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Michele Lora</name></author><category term="Output" /><summary type="html">The paper titled Quantitative Verification and Design Space Exploration Under Uncertainty with Parametric Stochastic Contracts, authored by Chanwook Oh, Michele Lora and Pierluigi Nuzzo, has been accepted at the 2022 IEEE International Conference on Computer-aided Design (ICCAD)</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A DeFacto paper has been accepted at ISIE 2022</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2022/isie2022/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A DeFacto paper has been accepted at ISIE 2022" /><published>2022-02-19T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-02-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2022/ISIE2022</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2022/isie2022/">&lt;p class=&quot;text-justify&quot;&gt;The paper titled &lt;strong&gt;A Hierarchical Modeling Approach to Improve Scheduling of

&lt;p class=&quot;text-justify&quot;&gt;Timely response to sudden production events and requirements shifts
is a key feature of Industry 4.0. It requires
techniques to manipulate and optimize the production processes,
and components providing an high degree of reconfigurability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-justify&quot;&gt;To acknowledge to such demands, this paper presents a 
multi-level and hierarchical approach to manufacturing processes modeling. 
Models are structured to represent the production hierarchically: partitioning
recipes in a set of tasks, allocated to 
machines’ manufacturing services and expressed as a sequence of elementary actions.
Then, we propose a run-time scheduling algorithm able to exploit the novel
structure given to knowledge by the proposed modeling approach.
The algorithm aims at minimizing the makespan while maximizing machines utilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-justify&quot;&gt;We validate the contributions of this paper on a full-fledged production line. 
The modeling strategy has been implemented in SysML: a well-known systems modeling language.
The experiments show the presented model and the proposed scheduling approach 
enabling a more precise and more performing control over the manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Michele Lora</name></author><category term="Output" /><summary type="html">The paper titled A Hierarchical Modeling Approach to Improve Scheduling of Manufacturing Processes, authored by Sebastiano Gaiardelli, Stefano Spellini, Michele Lora and Franco Fummi, has been accepted at the 2022 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Work-in-Progress and Demo of CHASE to be presented at the 2022 CPS-IoT Week</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2022/iccps-wip2022/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Work-in-Progress and Demo of CHASE to be presented at the 2022 CPS-IoT Week" /><published>2022-02-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-02-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2022/ICCPS_WiP2022</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2022/iccps-wip2022/">&lt;p class=&quot;text-justify&quot;&gt;A Work-in-Progress and demo about CHASE has been accepted at the

of compositional modeling formalisms and scalable algorithms for
high-assurance design of industrial cyber-physical systems, with emphasis on
smart manufacturing systems. A requirement engineering methodology is

&lt;p class=&quot;text-justify&quot;&gt;This paper presents a software architecture extending the classical automation pyramid
to control and reconfigure flexible, service-oriented manufacturing systems.
At the Planning level, the architecture requires 
a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) consistent with the 
International Society Automation (ISA) standard.
Then, the Supervisory level is automated by introducing a novel component, called
Automation Manager. 
The new component interacts upward with the MES, and
downward with a set of servers providing access to the manufacturing
machines.
The communication with machines relies on the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA)
standard protocol, which allows exposing production tasks as
``services’’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-justify&quot;&gt;The proposed software architecture has been prototyped to control a real
production line, originally controlled by a commercial MES, unable to fully
exploit the flexibility provided by the case study manufacturing system.
Meanwhile, the proposed architecture is fully exploiting the production line’s
flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Michele Lora</name></author><category term="Output" /><summary type="html">The paper titled A Software Architecture to Control Service-Oriented Manufacturing Systems, authored by Sebastiano Gaiardelli, Stefano Spellini, Marco Panato, and Franco Fummi, has been accepted as an interactive presentation at the 2022 IEEE/ACM Conference on Design Automation and Testing in Europe (DATE).</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Conference paper accepted at FDL 2021</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2021/fdl2021/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Conference paper accepted at FDL 2021" /><published>2021-07-30T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-07-30T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2021/FDL2021</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2021/fdl2021/">&lt;p class=&quot;text-justify&quot;&gt;The paper titled &lt;strong&gt;Modeling in Industry 5.0: What Is There and What Is

&lt;p class=&quot;text-justify&quot;&gt;The Industry 4.0 trend speeds up the adoption of a variety of technologies. In
modern manufacturing, system data are collected both from the field through
sensors and by exploiting complex simulations. Data analysis techniques became
crucial to build and maintain any efficient production line, while autonomous
systems and robots are the main focus of researchers and practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-justify&quot;&gt;This pervasive use of artificial intelligence derived technologies pushed humans
to the border of production systems. Industry 5.0 aims at bringing the attention
back to humans in production lines while magnifying their interactions with
intelligent systems. This new trend will impact the design of future
manufacturing infrastructures, increasing their complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-justify&quot;&gt;Engineers will need modeling and developing tools able to capture this
complexity. In this paper, we analyze the modeling languages and tools being
used, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we propose some possible
directions to provide engineers with the expressive power needed to tackle the
challenges posed by Industry 5.0.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Michele Lora</name></author><category term="Output" /><summary type="html">The paper titled Modeling in Industry 5.0: What Is There and What Is Missing, authored by Sebastiano Gaiardelli, Stefano Spellini, Michele Lora and Franco Fummi, has been accepted at the 2021 Forum on specification and Design Languages (FDL).</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Conference paper accepted at ETFA 2021</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2021/etfa2021/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Conference paper accepted at ETFA 2021" /><published>2021-07-07T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-07-07T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2021/ETFA2021</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2021/etfa2021/">&lt;p class=&quot;text-justify&quot;&gt;The paper titled &lt;strong&gt;Enabling Component Reuse in Model-based System Engineering of

&lt;p class=&quot;text-justify&quot;&gt;In this work, we outline a design flow contemplating the reuse of already
existing manufacturing lines’ models, while designing novel advanced production
systems. To enable such a flow, we propose a methodology extracting
System Modeling Language (SysML) structural diagrams from AutomationML descriptions.
Then, we propose to design the system functionalities on top of the produced 
diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-justify&quot;&gt;The paper shows the application of the methodology to a concrete manufacturing
line, the structure of which was originally modeled using AutomationML. To
exemplify the advantages of the methodology, we exploit the models being
generated to automatically extract a digital twin for the production system
transportation line. The resulting digital twin is compliant with a well-known
plant simulation tool.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Michele Lora</name></author><category term="Output" /><summary type="html">The paper titled Enabling Component Reuse in Model-based System Engineering of Cyber-Physical Production Systems, authored by Stefano Spellini, Sebastiano Gaiardelli, Michele Lora and Franco Fummi, has been accepted at the 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA 2021).</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">DeFacto will be at IEEE/ACM DATE 2021</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2020/date-ubooth/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="DeFacto will be at IEEE/ACM DATE 2021" /><published>2020-11-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-11-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2020/DATE-UBooth</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2020/date-ubooth/">&lt;p class=&quot;text-justify&quot;&gt;DeFacto will be present at the IEEE/ACM Conference on Design Automation and Test in Europe 2021.
